  "description": "People are always impressed when I can accurately identify birds simply by listening to their calls, and nothing else. It seems like a strange, difficult task to learn this skill, but in reality, anyone can with a bit of practice. That's where my website comes in. When a user enters the website and logs in, they can practice learning the most common bird calls from their region with a quiz that has a flashcard-like structure. Progress is saved to their account, so they can pick up where they left off and see their skills improve.",
